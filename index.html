            A: Yes, can you change my card status from a college to normal account?
            <br>
            B: Of course, but you'll have to come to the bank to do that.
            <br>
            A: Alright, I'll be down first thing tomorrow.
            <br>

            B: Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?

            <br>

            <br>
            B: That can't be right; I have not used it in months!
            <br>
            A: Are you saying you did not make that charge?
            <br>
            B: That's exactly what I am saying.
            <br>
            A: Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.
            <br>
            B: I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.
            <br>
